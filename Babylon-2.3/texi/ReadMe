Texi (K1 and K3)

This is the Component Description and Diagnosis implementation as described in
chapter 4 of the babylon book: The AI Workbench BABYLON.

On the Macintosh load the knowledge bases as usual from the Babylon Load-kb 
menu entry.

Otherwise do:

(load "texi/configs/k1.cl") or
(load "texi/configs/k3.cl").

There is a sample file (xyz-ex.cl) associated to each knowledge base 
which should be opened in an editor buffer and evaluated form by form.
