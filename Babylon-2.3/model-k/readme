MODEL-K

To close the gap between knowledge level and symbol level, we present MODEL-K,
a language that allows to specify conceptual models first and to refine them to
operational systems later on. This leads to systems that correctly reflect their
underlying conceptual model. They are more perspicuous, easier to
communicate and to explain to the user, and easier to maintain. Since both,
modelling and operationalizing may be interleaved, MODEL-K supports prototyping
as early as possible and on the highest level possible.

This software is part of a research project  partially
funded by the Esprit Basic Research  Programme of the Commission of the European
Communities as project  number 3178. The partners  in this project are the
University of Amsterdam (NL), 
the  German National Research Institute for Computer-Science GMD (D), 
the Netherlands Energy Research Foundation ECN (NL),
and BSR-Consulting(D)}.
